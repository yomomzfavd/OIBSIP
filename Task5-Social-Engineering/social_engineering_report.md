Social Engineering Attacks – Research Report

Executive Summary  
This report explores the tactics of social engineering attacks, including phishing, pretexting, baiting, and the emerging threat of AI deepfakes. It examines real-world case studies such as the RSA and Target breaches, as well as deepfake-enabled fraud incidents. The report highlights the financial, reputational, and operational impact of such attacks and provides preventive strategies, including employee awareness, multi-factor authentication, and zero-trust security. The findings stress that human error remains the weakest link in cybersecurity defenses.  


Introduction
Social engineering is a tactic cybercriminals use to manipulate people into divulging personal information or performing actions that compromise security (Coppock, 2025). These attacks are among the most common and dangerous threats organizations face today.

Types of Social Engineering Attacks
2.1 Phishing
Phishing involves fraudulent emails, messages, or websites designed to trick victims into sharing sensitive data such as login credentials or financial information.
Example: In 2020, Twitter suffered a major phishing attack where attackers gained access to internal systems, leading to high-profile account takeovers (Fox and Kelion, 2020).

2.2 Pretexting
Pretexting is when attackers fabricate a false scenario to obtain sensitive data. For instance, an attacker may impersonate IT support to convince an employee to share login details (Verizon, 2023).

2.3 Baiting
Baiting uses a physical or digital lure, such as leaving infected USB drives in public spaces or offering free downloads embedded with malware (EasyDMARC, 2022).

2.4 AI Deep Fake
AI deepfake scams use artificial intelligence to create fake videos and audio recordings of real people. Scammers use these AI scams to manipulate victims into taking actions like donating money, sharing sensitive information, or clicking malicious links (Coppock, 2025).

3. Case Studies
•	RSA Security Breach (2011): A phishing email containing a malicious Excel attachment compromised RSA’s SecurID tokens, which impacted multiple organizations relying on RSA for authentication (Greenberg, 2021).
•	Target Data Breach (2013): Attackers used stolen vendor credentials obtained via a phishing campaign to access Target’s network, leading to the theft of 40 million credit card details (Krebs, 2014). This breach underscores the need for robust third-party access management and employee awareness training
•	Ubiquiti Networks (2015): Pretexting and CEO fraud led to $46.7 million in losses when attackers impersonated company executives via email (SentinelOne, 2025).
•	Deepfake CFO Impersonation (2024): the British engineering firm Arup was reportedly attacked by a sophisticated deepfake attack by the attacker masquerading as the CFO and other senior leaders of the firm leading to the loss of $25 million (SentinelOne, 2025).

4. Impact of Social Engineering Attacks  
Social engineering attacks have significant consequences:  

1. Financial Losses: Billions lost annually from scams, with phishing accounting for 36% of data breaches in 2024 (Verizon, 2025).  
2. Reputation Damage: Organizations risk losing customer trust after breaches.  
3. Regulatory Penalties: Data protection regulations such as GDPR can impose heavy fines.  
4. Operational Disruption: Attacks can shut down systems, delay operations, and harm productivity.  

5. Preventive Measures
1.	Security Awareness Training: Regular employee training to recognize phishing, baiting, and pretexting attempts (ENISA, 2021).
2.	Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Reduces the impact of stolen credentials.
3.	Email Filtering and Monitoring: Helps detect phishing attempts before reaching users.
4.	Incident Response Plans: Organizations must be prepared to react quickly to social engineering incidents.
5.	Zero-Trust Architecture: Never assume internal communications are inherently safe.
6.	Limit what you share online: Avoid posting high-quality videos, voice recordings, or photos publicly. These are prime materials for deep-fake creators (Staysafeonline.org, 2024).

Conclusion 
Social engineering remains one of the most effective initial access techniques for attackers because it targets the human element. A defense-in-depth approach that combines technical controls (MFA, email authentication, filtering), robust vendor governance, and continuous people-centered training and testing provides the best chance to reduce risk. Organizations should assume some phishing attempts will succeed and prepare detection and response capabilities accordingly.
